Please see the README and features.txt files in the original dataset to learn more about the feature selection for this dataset.

For this project it was neccessary to extra measurements that were of type mean or standard deviations in the origina data.  Here are the variables that were extracted -

"tbodyacc-mean()-x"
"tbodyacc-mean()-y"
"tbodyacc-mean()-z"
"tbodyacc-std()-x"

"angle(z,gravity-mean)"

The average of the above values for each subject and activity are tabulated in the data set.
